    <p>My Ph.D. work focuses on developing deep-learning methods with applications
    in neural, graph, and timeseries data.
    Currently, I'm working on self-supervised learning for classifying neuron types,
    improving graph transformers, and trying to understand training dynamics of deep
    networks.

    <p>
    I also co-created and now maintain
    <a href="https://github.com/neuro-galaxy/torch_brain">torch-brain</a>,
    an open-source PyTorch-based framework for optimizing the deep-learning toolbox for
    neural data

    At Rivos, a chip-design startup, I developed a power and network limiters for
    a machine learning accelerator, gaining deep insights into GPU architecture. This
    experience informs my approach to designing efficient, large-scale deep
    learning training frameworks.

    My work at TI revolved around designing Digital Signal-Processing algorithms
    and systems for radio-frequency ADCs. Work was a mix of circuit-level design
    and writing low-level firmware. This experience has enabled me to think
    deeply and mathematically about signals and how to extract data from them,
    which translates to strong fundamentals in understanding and building for
    neural, graph, and time-varying signals.

    Some of the projects I worked on are deployed in present-day cell-phone
    towers, enabling 5G internet. I also was an inventor on two US Patents
    <a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/US11496124B1/en">[1]</a>,
    <a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/US20250055473A1/en">[2]</a> filed by TI.
