    <p>My Ph.D. work focuses on developing deep-learning methods for neural, graph,
    and timeseries data. Currently, I'm working on cell-type classification from
    neural spike signals, improving transformers for graph node-classification,
    and enhancing interpretability of large-scale neuroscience models.

    I have also dedicated significant time to developing an open-source library
    for deep-learning on neuroscience data

    At Rivos, a chip-design startup, I developed a power and network limiter for
    a GPU-like system, gaining deep insights into GPU architecture. This
    experience informs my approach to designing efficient, large-scale deep
    learning training frameworks.

    My work at TI revolved around designing Digital Signal-Processing algorithms
    and systems for radio-frequency ADCs. Work was a mix of circuit-level design
    and writing low-level firmware. This experience has enabled me to think
    deeply and mathematically about signals and how to extract data from them,
    which translates to strong fundamentals in understanding and building for
    neural, graph, and time-varying signals.

    Some of the projects I worked on are deployed in present-day cell-phone
    towers, enabling 5G internet. I also was an inventor on two US Patents [1],
    [2] filed by TI.
