  description: |
    My Ph.D. work focuses on developing deep-learning methods for neural, graph,
    and timeseries data. Currently, I'm working on cell-type classification from
    neural spike signals, improving transformers for graph node-classification,
    and enhancing interpretability of large-scale neuroscience models.

    I've also dedicated significant time to developing an open-source package
    for deep-learning on neuroscience data (torch_brain).
