    Identifying the functional identity of individual neurons is essential for
    interpreting circuit dynamics, yet remains a major challenge in large-scale
    in vivo recordings where anatomical and molecular labels are often unavailable.
    Here we introduce NuCLR, a self-supervised framework that learns context-aware
    representations of neuron identity by modeling each neuron's role within the 
    broader population. NuCLR employs a spatiotemporal transformer that captures both
    within-neuron dynamics and across-neuron interactions, and is trained with a
    sample-wise contrastive objective that encourages stable, discriminative embeddings
    across time. Across multiple open-access datasets, NuCLR outperforms prior methods
    in both cell type and brain region classification. It enables zero-shot generalization
    to entirely new populations—without retraining or access to stimulus labels—offering
    a scalable approach for real-time, functional decoding of neuron identity across
    diverse experimental settings.

    Recent work shows scale is crucial for brain decoding, with more data improving
    accuracy. However, large-scale decoding across datasets is challenging due to
    neural circuit heterogeneity. Each brain region has unique cellular sub-types,
    and responses to stimuli vary across regions and sub-types. It's unknown if
    pre-training and transferring decoding models between tasks, sub-types, and
    regions is possible. To investigate, we developed a multi-task transformer
    architecture trained on the Allen Institute's Brain Observatory dataset. This
    dataset contains responses from over 100,000 neurons in 6 mouse brain areas,
    recorded via two-photon calcium imaging during visual stimuli exposure. Our
    results show transfer is possible - combining data from different sources
    benefits downstream decoding tasks. We can transfer between regions and
    sub-types, showing common information exists in diverse circuits that can be
    extracted by a well-designed model. Interestingly, the model's latent
    representations distinguished between brain regions and cellular sub-types,
    despite no explicit information about these distinctions. Our work
    demonstrates training large-scale neural decoding models on diverse data is
    feasible, providing a way to study differences and similarities in
    heterogeneous neural circuits.

    Graph neural networks are typically trained on individual datasets, often
    requiring highly specialized models and extensive hyperparameter tuning. This
    dataset-specific approach arises because each graph dataset often has unique
    node features and diverse connectivity structures, making it difficult to
    build a generalist model. To address these challenges, we introduce a
    scalable multi-graph multi-task pretraining approach specifically tailored
    for node classification tasks across diverse graph datasets from different
    domains. Our method, Graph Foundation Model (GraphFM), leverages a
    Perceiver-based encoder that employs learned latent tokens to compress
    domain-specific features into a common latent space. This approach enhances
    the model's ability to generalize across different graphs and allows for
    scaling across diverse data. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach by
    training a model on 152 different graph datasets comprising over 7.4 million
    nodes and 189 million edges, establishing the first set of scaling laws for
    multi-graph pretraining on datasets spanning many domains (e.g., molecules,
    citation and product graphs). Our results show that pretraining on a diverse
    array of real and synthetic graphs improves the model's adaptability and
    stability, while performing competitively with state-of-the-art specialist
    models. This work illustrates that multi-graph pretraining can significantly
    reduce the burden imposed by the current graph training paradigm, unlocking
    new capabilities for the field of graph neural networks by creating a single
    generalist model that performs competitively across a wide range of datasets
    and tasks.

    Our ability to use deep learning approaches to decipher neural activity would
    likely benefit from greater scale, in terms of both the model size and the
    datasets. However, the integration of many neural recordings into one unified
    model is challenging, as each recording contains the activity of different
    neurons from different individual animals. In this paper, we introduce a
    training framework and architecture designed to model the population dynamics
    of neural activity across diverse, large-scale neural recordings. Our method
    first tokenizes individual spikes within the dataset to build an efficient
    representation of neural events that captures the fine temporal structure of
    neural activity. We then employ cross-attention and a PerceiverIO backbone to
    further construct a latent tokenization of neural population activities.
    Utilizing this architecture and training framework, we construct a large-
    scale multi-session model trained on large datasets from seven nonhuman
    primates, spanning over 158 different sessions of recording from over 27,373
    neural units and over 100 hours of recordings. In a number of different
    tasks, we demonstrate that our pretrained model can be rapidly adapted to
    new, unseen sessions with unspecified neuron correspondence, enabling few-
    shot performance with minimal labels. This work presents a powerful new
    approach for building deep learning tools to analyze neural data and stakes
    out a clear path to training at scale for neural decoding models.
